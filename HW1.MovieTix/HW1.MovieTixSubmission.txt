Professor, I had a hard time uploading my HW because it only allows for one file per submission. My problem is that created 3 files for my HW. I created an interface file, an implementation file, and the main() program file.

Since I couldnt upload my files to toyocat.net, I uploaded it to github and I am now providing you with a link where you can download all three files yourself.

Thank you!!
